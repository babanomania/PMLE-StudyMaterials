## Big Data and Machine Learning on the Google Cloud

### Introduction

- Google has been working with data and AI since 1998, and in 2008, Google Cloud platform was launched to provide cloud computing and storage services.
- Google Cloud infrastructure can be thought of in three layers:
- Networking and security (base layer)
- Compute and storage (middle layer)
- Big data and machine learning products (top layer)
- Compute and storage layer is decoupled, which means they can scale independently based on needs.
- The top layer includes big data and machine learning products that allow performing tasks like ingest, store, process and deliver business insights, data pipelines and ML models.
- The course focuses on the middle and top layers, compute and storage, and big data and machine learning products.
- The course includes exploring the history of big data and ML products to understand relevant product categories, and a customer example of adapting Google Cloud for big data and ML needs.
- Hands-on practice using big data tools is provided to analyze a public data set.
- To learn more about networking and security, check cloud.google.com/training.

### Compute
- Google Cloud Infrastructure has three main computing services: Compute Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), and App Engine.
- Compute Engine provides virtual compute and storage resources that are similar to physical data centers, giving maximum flexibility to those who prefer to manage server instances themselves.
- GKE runs containerized applications in a cloud environment, using containers to package code with all its dependencies, and is more scalable than Compute Engine.
- App Engine is a fully managed platform-as-a-service offering that allows for more resources to be focused on application logic by binding code to libraries that provide access to the infrastructure application needs.
- Cloud Functions is a completely serverless execution environment that executes code in response to events and is often referred to as functions as a service.
- Cloud Run is a fully managed compute platform that enables users to run requests or event-driven stateless workloads without having to worry about servers, automatically scaling up and down as needed.
- Google Photos relies on the compute capability provided by Google Cloud to implement their video stabilization feature, which uses a high-performing machine learning model trained on millions of videos.
- To train sophisticated machine learning models, Google uses a vast network of data centers and a custom-developed application-specific integrated circuit called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU).
- TPUs are designed to accelerate machine learning workloads and increase computing speed more than 200 times by tailoring architecture to meet the computation needs of a specific domain, such as matrix multiplication and machine learning.
- Cloud TPUs have been integrated across Google products and services to provide state-of-the-art hardware and supercomputing technology.

### Storage

- Compute and storage are decoupled for proper scaling capabilities in cloud computing.
- Google Cloud offers fully managed database and storage services, including Cloud Storage, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner, Firestore, and BigQuery.
- Choosing the right option to store and process data depends on the data type and business need.
- Unstructured data is information stored in a non-tabular form and is usually suited to cloud storage. Structured data represents information stored in tables, rows, and columns.
- Cloud Storage is a managed service for storing unstructured data. It has four primary storage classes: standard, nearline, cold line, and archive storage.
- Transactional workloads require standardized queries and fast data inserts and updates to maintain a system snapshot. Analytical workloads require complex queries and involve reading entire data sets.
- Cloud SQL and Cloud Spanner are options for transactional workloads that need to be accessed using SQL. Firestore is a transactional NoSQL document-oriented database that can be accessed without SQL.
- BigQuery is the best option for analytical workloads that require SQL commands and the analysis of petabyte-scale data sets.
- Cloud Bigtable provides a scalable NoSQL solution for analytical workloads that require real-time high-throughput applications with millisecond latency.

### The history of big data and ML products

- Google faced challenges related to big data early on due to large, fast-changing, and varied data sets.
- In 2002, Google released the Google file system (GFS), designed to handle data sharing and petabyte storage at scale.
- In 2004, Google introduced MapReduce, a new style of data processing designed to manage large-scale data processing across big clusters of commodity servers.
- In 2005, Google released Cloud Bigtable, a high-performance NoSQL database service for large analytical and operational workloads.
- In 2008, Dremel was introduced, which took a new approach to big data processing by breaking the data into smaller chunks called shards and then compressing them.
- In 2010, Google released Colossus, a cluster-level file system and successor to the Google file system, as well as BigQuery, a fully managed serverless data warehouse with built-in machine learning capabilities.
- In 2012, Spanner was released, which is a globally available and scalable relational database.
- In 2015, Google released TensorFlow, a free and open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence, as well as Pub/Sub, a service used for streaming analytics and data integration pipelines to ingest and distribute data.
- In 2018, Google released the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) and AutoML, a suite of machine learning products.
- In 2021, Google released Vertex AI, a unified ML platform.
- These products and services are made available through Google Cloud and include cloud storage, Dataproc, Cloud Bigtable, BigQuery, Dataflow, Firestore, Pub/Sub, Looker, Cloud Spanner, AutoML, and Vertex AI.

### Customer example Gojek

- Gojek is a unicorn start-up company based in Jakarta, Indonesia, that offers motorcycle taxis (known as ojek), ride-hailing, food delivery, and grocery shopping services.
- Gojek started as a call center for ojek bookings in 2010 and launched its mobile application in 2015, which led to hyper-growth very quickly.
- Gojek has collected customer data since its inception and has relied heavily on technology and selecting the right technologies to grow and expand into new markets.
- Gojek chose Google Cloud to run its applications and data.
- One of Gojek's main goals is to match the right driver with the right request as quickly as possible.
- Gojek faced challenges with data latency and determining which location had too many or too few drivers to meet demand.
- To solve the data latency challenge, Gojek migrated its data pipelines to Google Cloud and used dataflow for streaming data processing and BigQuery for real-time business insights.
- To solve the challenge of determining driver locations, Gojek used data flow to build a streaming event data pipeline that allowed driver locations to ping Pub/Sub every 30 seconds and used data flow to process the data.
- The pipeline aggregated supply pings from drivers against booking requests and connected to Gojek's notification system to alert drivers of the best locations to go to.
- Gojek was able to visualize and identify supply and demand issues using Google Cloud's big data and machine learning products.
- Gojek has been able to actively monitor requests to ensure that drivers are in the areas with the highest demand, which brings faster bookings for riders and more work for drivers.

### Big Data Challenges

The video discusses the four major challenges faced by data engineers and data scientists known as The Four Vs:

* Variety: Data comes in different formats and from various sources.
* Volume: Data can range from gigabytes to petabytes, which requires scalable pipeline code and infrastructure.
* Velocity: Data needs to be processed in near real-time as it reaches the system.
* Veracity: Data quality may be compromised due to inconsistencies and uncertainties from different data types and sources.

The challenges highlighted are common considerations for pipeline developers, and the section aims to provide better understanding of available tools to build a streaming data pipeline and avoid these challenges.

### Message oriented architecture

- Data ingestion is the first stage in a data pipeline where large amounts of streaming data are received.
- Data can come from many different devices and methods, making it challenging to distribute event messages to the right subscribers and ensure reliable, secure, and performant services.
- Pub/Sub is a distributed messaging service by Google Cloud that can handle distributed message-oriented architectures at scale.
- Pub/Sub receives messages from various device streams, ensures at least once delivery, and offers open APIs, global service, and end-to-end encryption.
- Pub/Sub uses a topic as a central element, allowing for decoupling of publishers and subscribers and enabling lightly coupled architectures with many different publishers and subscribers.
- Pub/Sub supports many different inputs and outputs, and messages can be reliably sent to a data warehouse through an elastic streaming pipeline.

### Designing streaming pipelines with Apache Beam

- Apache Beam is a popular solution for designing streaming pipelines.
- Dataflow creates a pipeline to process both streaming and batch data, allowing for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) of data into a data warehouse for analysis.
- When designing a pipeline, data engineers should consider if the pipeline code will be compatible with both batch and streaming data, if there are existing templates or solutions that can be referenced, and if the SDK being used can handle late data and mid-flight aggregations and windowing.
- Apache Beam is a unified, portable, and extensible open source programming model for defining and executing data processing pipelines, including ETL, batch, and stream processing.
- Apache Beam provides pipeline templates and allows for writing pipelines in Java, Python, or Go.
- The Apache Beam SDK is a collection of software development tools that provide libraries for transformations and data connectors to sources and syncs.
- Apache Beam creates a model representation from your code that's portable across many runners, with Dataflow being a popular choice.

### Implementing streaming pipelines on Cloud Dataflow

- Apache Beam can create data processing pipelines
- Need an execution engine to implement these pipelines
- Consider questions when choosing an execution engine, such as maintenance overhead and pipeline scaling
- Dataflow is a fully managed service for executing Apache Beam pipelines in the Google Cloud ecosystem
- Dataflow handles infrastructure setup and maintenance, and is built on Google's infrastructure
- Dataflow allows for reliable auto-scaling to meet data pipeline demands
- Dataflow is serverless and noOps, meaning no operations team is required to manage it

- BigQuery serves as a common staging area for data analytics workloads, granting access to business analysts, data scientists, and machine learning engineers.

### Storage and analytics

- BigQuery provides both storage and SQL-based analytics services.
- The services are connected by Google's high-speed internal network that allows for independent scaling of storage and compute based on demand.
- BigQuery can ingest data from various sources, including internal, external, multi-cloud, and public data sets.
- After the data is stored, it's fully managed, automatically replicated, backed up, and set to auto scale.
- BigQuery can query external data sources like data stored in other Google Cloud Storage services or database services.
- Three basic patterns to load data into BigQuery are batch load, streaming, and generated data.
- BigQuery is optimized for running analytical queries over large data sets, can perform queries on terabytes of data in seconds and petabytes in minutes.
- BigQuery supports ad hoc analysis using standard SQL, geospatial analytics, building machine learning models using BigQuery ML, and building Rich interactive business intelligence dashboards using BigQuery BI engine.
- BigQuery runs interactive queries by default, but also offers batch queries.
- BigQuery has a slightly different user interface that may be noticed during a demonstration.

### BigQuery demo - San Francisco bike share

- The transcript is about exploring a public dataset for San Francisco Bike Share trips on Google BigQuery.
- SQL or structured query language skills are necessary to explore the dataset.
- Tips are given to navigate the BigQuery public data sets, such as using backticks for hyphens in project names and highlighting data sets with the command key.
- The schema of the San Francisco Bike Share dataset is shown, including the trip ID, duration, start time, station, and geographic data.
- Querying the dataset is demonstrated, including selecting columns and using aggregate functions such as counting the number of trips by station name.
- Grouping by station name is necessary when using aggregate functions, and the resulting table shows the total number of trips for each station.

### Introduction to BigQuery ML

- BigQuery has evolved to support the data to AI lifecycle, including building ML models.
- ML model building and training can be time-consuming, requiring data export, transformation, feature engineering, and model building and training.
- BigQuery ML allows creating and executing ML models on structured datasets using SQL queries in two steps: creating a model and writing a prediction query.
- Hyperparameters can be manually controlled or handed over to BigQuery, and BigQuery ML supports supervised and unsupervised models.
- Classification and regression models are recommended for beginners, with options to benchmark against more complex models like DNN.
- BigQuery ML also supports ML Ops to deploy, monitor, and manage ML production, including importing/exporting models and parameter tuning using Vertex AI Vizier.

### Using BigQuery ML to predict customer lifetime value

- The goal is to predict customer lifetime value (LTV) with a machine learning model.
- LTV is a common metric used to estimate how much revenue or profit you can expect from a customer given their history and customers with similar patterns.
- A Google analytics eCommerce data set from Google's own merchandise store will be used in this example.
- Fields that may be useful in determining high-value customers include customer lifetime, page views, total visits, average time spent on the site, total revenue brought in, and e-commerce transactions on the site.
- Columns of data are fed into the model and the model figures out the relationship to best predict the label.
- A record or row in the data set is called an example, observation, or instance.
- A label is a correct answer that comes from historical data, which is used to train the model to predict future data.
- Labels can be either numeric (requires a linear regression model) or categorical (requires a logistic regression model).
- Data columns in the data table are called features or potential features, and each column of data is like a cooking ingredient that can be used in the model.
- Feature engineering is the process of sifting through data, understanding the quality of each column of data, and working with teams to get the most features or more history.
- BigQuery ML automatically performs one-hot encoding and splits the data set into training data and evaluation data.
- Once the model is trained and its performance is satisfactory, it can be used to predict future data sets.

### BigQuery ML Project Phases

- **Phase One:** 
  - Extract, transform, and load data into BigQuery, if not already present. 
  - Use easy connectors to get data from other Google products like YouTube.
  - Enrich existing data warehouse with other data sources using SQL joins.

- **Phase Two:**
  - Select and pre-process features. 
  - Use SQL to create the training data set for the model to learn from.
  - BigQuery ML does some pre-processing, like one-hot encoding of categorical variables.

- **Phase Three:**
  - Create the model inside BigQuery using the `CREATE MODEL` command.
  - Specify model type and pass a SQL query with training data set.

- **Phase Four:**
  - Execute `ml.evaluate` query to evaluate model performance on evaluation data set.
  - Analyze loss metrics like root mean squared error for forecasting models and area under the curve accuracy, precision, and recall for classification models.

- **Phase Five:**
  - Use the trained model to make predictions using `ml.predict` command.
  - Results will have the predicted label field added to the field name.

### BigQuery ML key commands

Here are the key commands of BigQuery ML summarized in bullet points:

- To create a model, use the `CREATE MODEL` command.
- To overwrite an existing model, use the `CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL` command.
- Models have options, and the only required one is the model type.
- Use the `ML.WEIGHTS` command to inspect what the model learned, with the output being a numerical value indicating how important each feature is for predicting the label.
- Use the `ML.EVALUATE` command to evaluate the model's performance.
- To make batch predictions, use the `ML.PREDICT` command on a trained model and pass through the data set.
- In BigQuery ML, you need a field in your training data set titled "label" or specify which field(s) your labels are using as the input label columns in your model options.
- Your model features are the data columns that are part of your select statement after your `CREATE MODEL` statement.
- Use the `ML.FEATURE INFO` command to get statistics and metrics about the column for additional analysis after a model is trained.
- Model objects are stored in your BigQuery data set, and you can view information such as when it was last updated or how many training runs it completed.
- Creating a new model is as easy as writing `CREATE MODEL`, choosing a type, and passing in a training data set.
- Use linear regression for forecasting numeric fields and logistic regression for classification of discrete classes.
- Use `ML.TRAINING INFO` to view training progress while the model is running and even after it's complete.
- Use `ML.WEIGHTS` to inspect what the model learned about the importance of each feature.
- Use `ML.EVALUATE` to see how well the model performed against its evaluation data set.
- Use `ML.PREDICT` to get predictions, referencing your model name and prediction data set.

### Summary

### Options to build ML models

Here are the key points from the transcript:

- Google Cloud provides four options for building machine learning (ML) models.
- The options are: 
  - BigQuery ML, which uses SQL queries to create and execute ML models in BigQuery for tabular data.
  - Pre-built APIs, which allow you to use existing ML models created by Google without building your own models.
  - AutoML, which is a no-code solution for building your own ML models on Vertex AI through a point-and-click interface for tabular, image, text, and video data.
  - Custom Training, which allows you to code your own ML environment for full control over the ML pipeline for tabular, image, text, and video data.
- The best option for building an ML model will depend on your business needs and ML expertise.
- Key factors to consider when choosing an option are data type, training data size, ML and coding expertise required, flexibility to tune hyperparameters, and time to train the model.
- BigQuery ML is suitable if you are familiar with SQL and have tabular data in BigQuery.
- Pre-built APIs are user-friendly and require no ML expertise, making them a good choice for business users or developers with little ML experience.
- AutoML is a good choice if you want to build custom models with your own training data while spending minimal time coding.
- Custom Training provides full control of the ML workflow for ML engineers and data scientists.

### Pre built APIs

- Pre-built APIs are offered as services and can save time and effort in building, curating, and training data sets for machine learning models.
- Good machine learning models require high-quality training data, typically hundreds of thousands of records, to train a custom model.
- Pre-built APIs can serve as building blocks for creating an application without the expense or complexity of creating custom models.
- Some pre-built APIs include speech-to-text, natural language processing, translation, text-to-speech, vision, and video intelligence.
- Google has already trained these models using their own data sets, meaning less work for the user.
- The vision API can be tried out in a browser by navigating to cloud.google.com/vision in Chrome and uploading an image.
- To build a production model, a JSON object request must be passed to the API and the response must be parsed.

### AutoML

#### Introduction
- AutoML stands for Automated Machine Learning.
- AutoML was built to automate the process of training and deploying ML models to save time and effort.

#### Technologies
- Transfer Learning: builds a knowledge base in the field by taking advantage of pre-trained models that have been trained on similar larger data sets.
- Neural Architecture Search: finds the optimal model for the relevant project.

#### Benefits
- No code solution that trains high-quality custom machine learning models with minimal effort and requires little machine learning expertise.
- Allows data scientists to focus on tasks like defining business problems or evaluating and improving model results.
- Useful as a tool to quickly prototype models and explore new data sets before investing in development.

- AutoML allows users to train their own machine learning models using their own data.
- For each data type, AutoML has different models like classification, regression, forecasting, entity extraction, sentiment analysis, object tracking, and action recognition.

#### Conclusion
- AutoML is a powerful tool that can help across different data types and objectives.

### Custom Training

* Google Cloud offers several options for building machine learning models:
  * BigQuery ML pre-built APIs
  * AutoML
  * Custom Training
* Custom Training allows you to code your own machine learning model using Vertex AI Workbench.
* Workbench is a single development environment for the entire data science workflow, including exploring, training, and deploying a machine learning model with code.
* Before coding, you must decide on the environment for your ML training code:
  * Pre-built container: a fully furnished kitchen with cabinets and appliances representing dependencies and cookware representing libraries needed for your ML training. This is best if your training needs a platform like TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, or XGBoost, and Python code.
  * Custom container: an empty room where you define the exact tools you need to complete the job.

## The Machine Learning Workflow with Vertex AI

### Introduction

- The focus of this section is on the machine learning workflow with Vertex AI, Google's AI platform, from data preparation to model deployment.
- The process of building a custom ML model is similar to serving food in a restaurant, starting with preparing raw ingredients to serving dishes to a table.
- Machine learning is different from traditional programming where data plus rules (algorithms) lead to answers.
- Machine learning involves feeding a machine a large amount of data along with answers to conclude from the data, allowing the machine to learn and solve puzzles on its own.
- Cloud storage and computing are essential for successful machine learning.
- Three key stages of the learning process are data preparation, model training, and model serving, which are iterative.
- Data used in machine learning can either be structured (numbers and text saved in tables) or unstructured (data that can't be put into tables like images and videos).
- Vertex AI provides two options to build ML models: AutoML (codeless solution) and Custom Training (code-based solution).
- Vertex AI provides many features to support the ML workflow, including Feature Store, Vizier, Explainable AI, and Pipelines.

### Data Preparation

- The first stage of an automl workflow is data preparation, which involves uploading data and preparing it for model training with feature engineering.
- When uploading a data set in the Vertex AI user interface, you need to provide a name, select the data type, and objective.
- Automl allows four types of data: image, tabular, text, and video.
- Labels need to be added to the data to provide a training target. A label can be manually added or added by using Google's paid label service.
- After uploading data to automl, the next step is preparing the data for model training with feature engineering, which is like processing ingredients before cooking.
- Feature engineering involves preparing features, which are factors that contribute to the prediction. Vertex AI has a feature store to centralize and organize machine learning features.
- The benefits of using Vertex AI feature store include shareable features, reusable features, scalable features, and an easy-to-use interface.

### Model Training

- Model training is like cooking a recipe, where data is the ingredients.
- Model training involves two steps: model training and model evaluation.
- Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an umbrella term that includes computers mimicking human intelligence, while machine learning is a subset of AI that mainly refers to supervised and unsupervised learning.
- Supervised learning is task-driven and identifies a goal, while unsupervised learning is data-driven and identifies a pattern.
- Classification and regression are major types of supervised learning, while clustering, association, and dimensionality reduction are major types of unsupervised learning.
- Google Cloud provides four machine learning options, including AutoML and pre-built APIs, where the best model is selected to meet the business goal automatically.
- With BigQuery ML and custom training, hyperparameters need to be specified, which are user-defined knobs that help guide the machine learning process.
- AutoML automatically adjusts hyperparameters using a neural architect search that finds the best-fit model by comparing the performance against thousands of other models.

### Model Evaluation

- Model evaluation is a crucial step in model training to ensure that it meets expectations.
- Vertex AI provides comprehensive evaluation metrics for model performance, which includes two sets of measurements based on the confusion matrix and feature importance.
- A confusion matrix is a table that measures the predicted and actual values of a classification problem, consisting of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative combinations.
- Recall and precision are two popular metrics used to evaluate model performance, with recall measuring how many positive cases were predicted correctly and precision measuring how many predicted positive cases were actually positive.
- Precision and recall often involve a trade-off, depending on the use case and the goal of the model.
- Vertex AI platform visualizes the Precision and Recall curve to optimize for the required metric.
- Feature importance is displayed through a bar chart to determine the contribution of each feature in a prediction, which helps in feature selection for the model.
- Vertex AI's comprehensive machine learning functionality is called explainable AI, which includes a set of tools and frameworks to interpret the predictions made by machine learning models.

### Model Deployment and Monitoring

- Model serving is the final stage of the machine learning workflow, consisting of model deployment and model monitoring.
- Model management exists throughout the workflow to manage the underlying machine learning infrastructure.
- ML apps combine machine learning development with operations, applying DevOps principles to machine learning models to solve production challenges.
- ML apps advocates for automation and monitoring at each step of the ML system construction, enabling continuous integration, training, and delivery.
- Model deployment options include deploying to an endpoint for immediate results with low latency, batch prediction for accumulated data processing, and offline prediction for specific environments.
- Model monitoring is critical in ML ops and is facilitated by Vertex AI Pipelines, which automates, monitors, and governs ML systems by orchestrating workflows in a serverless manner.
- With Vertex AI Workbench, users can define their own pipelines using pre-built pipeline components.
- The combination of model deployment and monitoring completes the exploration of the machine learning workflow, ensuring smooth operation of the ML system.

### Lab introduction: Predicting loan risk with AutoML

In this lab, you will:
- Use AutoML, a codeless tool, to build a machine learning model to predict loan risk.
- Work with a dataset from a financial institution that contains 2050 data points.
- Note that AutoML requires at least 1,000 data points in a dataset.
- Practice the three phases of the machine learning workflow: data preparation, model training, and model serving.

### Lab recap Predicting loan risk with AutoML

- Lab used AutoML to build a machine learning model without writing any code
- Confusion matrix was used to evaluate the model's performance
- True positives were 100%, true negatives were 87%, false negatives were 0%, and false positives were 13%
- Having high true positives and true negatives and low false positives and false negatives is generally good, but it depends on business goals
- Model performance can be improved by using more accurate data, a larger dataset, a different ML model, or tuning hyperparameters
- Precision-recall curve shows how the model counts positive cases based on the confidence threshold
- Higher threshold increases precision but decreases recall, lower threshold decreases precision but increases recall
- Setting threshold to 0 produces highest recall of 100% and lowest precision of 50%
- Setting threshold to 1 produces highest precision of 100% and lowest recall of 1%
- Setting inappropriate thresholds can lead to high business risk and loss

### Summary
